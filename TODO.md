# TODO List

## Current Issues

### Database Schema Inconsistencies
- Internal Server Errors occurring due to column definition mismatches between services
- `created_at` column handling is inconsistent between `sync.py` and `admin.py`

   - [ ] Implement schema migration system

2. Error Handling Improvements:
   - [ ] Add better error messages for database operations
   - [ ] Implement proper error logging
   - [ ] Add retry mechanisms for transient failures

3. Testing:
   - [ ] Add unit tests for database operations
   - [ ] Add integration tests for API endpoints
   - [ ] Add schema validation tests

4. Documentation:
   - [ ] Document all API endpoints with examples
   - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide
   - [ ] Create development setup guide
