### Implementation Details:
1. **Scheduled Cleanup (Celery Beat)**:
   - Old jobs cleanup every 6 hours (keeping completed jobs for 24h, failed for 72h)
   - Query results cleanup every 4 hours (keeping results for 24h)
   - Stale jobs cleanup every 15 minutes (marking jobs as failed if running > 1h)

2. **Retry Logic**:
   - **Sync Tasks**:
     - Retries for Snowflake operational and programming errors
     - Max 3 retries with exponential backoff (max 10min delay)
     - Custom failure handling with detailed error tracking
   
   - **Query Tasks**:
     - Retries for DuckDB operational and programming errors
     - Max 2 retries with exponential backoff (max 5min delay)
     - Cleanup task with single retry for robustness

3. **Task Monitoring Endpoints** (`/api/v1/tasks/`):
   - `/status/{task_id}`: Get detailed task status and results
   - `/active`: List currently running tasks by queue
   - `/queues`: Get statistics for each task queue
   - `/workers`: Monitor Celery worker status and health

4. **Key Features**:
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Exponential backoff with jitter for better retry distribution
   - Detailed error tracking and status updates
   - Comprehensive monitoring capabilities
   - Regular cleanup of old data
