# AI Agents Data API Implementation Plan

## ✅ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Setup
- ✅ Project setup with FastAPI and Poetry
- ✅ Database integration (DuckDB)
- ✅ Token management and authentication
- ✅ Admin API implementation

### Implementation Details:
1. **Project Structure**:
   - FastAPI application with Poetry dependency management
   - Environment configuration with pydantic-settings
   - Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

2. **Authentication System**:
   - JWT-based authentication with Python-JOSE
   - Token generation and validation
   - Admin-only access control
   - Secure password hashing

3. **Database Setup**:
   - DuckDB integration for local data storage
   - Connection management and pooling
   - Schema initialization and management
   - Type mapping and data validation

## ✅ Phase 2: Database Integration
- ✅ Snowflake connection setup
- ✅ Query execution and result handling
- ✅ Data type mapping and conversion
- ✅ Error handling and retries

### Implementation Details:
1. **Snowflake Integration**:
   - Secure connection management
   - Query execution with error handling
   - Batch processing support
   - Schema and metadata retrieval

2. **Data Type Handling**:
   - Comprehensive type mapping between systems
   - NULL value handling
   - Date/time format standardization
   - Large result set management

## ✅ Phase 3: Core API Features
- ✅ Data access layer implementation
- ✅ Query execution endpoints
- ✅ Result format handling
- ✅ Data export formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet)

### Implementation Details:
1. **Query Processing**:
   - Secure query validation
   - Result pagination and streaming
   - Memory-efficient processing
   - Multiple output format support

2. **Export Functionality**:
   - CSV generation with proper escaping
   - JSON formatting with schema
   - Parquet file creation
   - Compression options

## ✅ Phase 4: Artefact Management
- ✅ Artefact storage implementation
- ✅ Upload/download functionality
- ✅ Artefact metadata tracking
- ✅ Cleanup and maintenance

### Implementation Details:
1. **Storage Management**:
   - Local file system organization
   - Metadata tracking in DuckDB
   - Automatic cleanup of old files
   - Space usage monitoring

## ✅ Phase 5: Snowflake Sync Implementation
- ✅ Table synchronization logic
- ✅ Incremental sync support
- ✅ Schema management
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

### Implementation Details:
1. **Sync Service**:
   - Full and incremental sync strategies
   - Schema validation and creation
   - Batch processing with progress tracking
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Status tracking and reporting

2. **Schema Management**:
   - Automatic schema detection
   - Type mapping between systems
   - Schema evolution handling
   - Constraint preservation

## ✅ Phase 6: Async Task Processing
- ✅ Celery integration with Redis
- ✅ Task queues and routing
- ✅ Monitoring and management
- ✅ Error handling and retries

### Implementation Details:
1. **Scheduled Cleanup (Celery Beat)**:
   - Old jobs cleanup every 6 hours (keeping completed jobs for 24h, failed for 72h)
   - Query results cleanup every 4 hours (keeping results for 24h)
   - Stale jobs cleanup every 15 minutes (marking jobs as failed if running > 1h)

2. **Retry Logic**:
   - **Sync Tasks**:
     - Retries for Snowflake operational and programming errors
     - Max 3 retries with exponential backoff (max 10min delay)
     - Custom failure handling with detailed error tracking
   
   - **Query Tasks**:
     - Retries for DuckDB operational and programming errors
     - Max 2 retries with exponential backoff (max 5min delay)
     - Cleanup task with single retry for robustness

3. **Task Monitoring Endpoints** (`/api/v1/tasks/`):
   - `/status/{task_id}`: Get detailed task status and results
   - `/active`: List currently running tasks by queue
   - `/queues`: Get statistics for each task queue
   - `/workers`: Monitor Celery worker status and health

4. **Key Features**:
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Exponential backoff with jitter for better retry distribution
   - Detailed error tracking and status updates
   - Comprehensive monitoring capabilities
   - Regular cleanup of old data
